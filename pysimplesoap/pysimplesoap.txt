PySimpleSOAP is a python SOAP library that ZimbraSOAP based on. Rather
than require it as a dependency, it is included in ZimbraSOAP. This is
due to a minor (two-line) patch required for ZimbraSOAP to function that
has yet to be accepted to PySimpleSOAP (issue #89), however, it may also
be conveneinet to have PySimpleSOAP included within the ZimbraSOAP
distribution anyhow.

PySimpleSOAP's project homepage is: http://code.google.com/p/pysimplesoap/

The version included is PySimpleSOAP v1.10. The original distribution,
the required patch and this documentation are included in pysimplesoap/.

Many thanks to them for a great Python SOAP library.
